Meta Choice with simple flow and rules

Motivation
----------

We need one easy way to validate alot choices flow with Django.
Sort of one status machine that can validate status for diferentes Models
in diferentes APPs with diferents Flow.

Some workflow program work with XML to create flow.
XML is one another easy way, but i don't like the ideia to create XMLs
and read this XMLs i like something with one big performance,
because we have alot users.
